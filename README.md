Description
---

The files in this repository will set up essential utilities on your AWS instances for an intercommunicating cluster of AWS nodes. 

Back-end Setup
---

1.) Create your nodes on AWS and distribute them among the different availability zones evenly 
  *(i.e. node1 in US-east-1a, node2 in US-east-1b, node3 in US-east-1c). An odd number of instances is recommended for this setup to maintain a quorum number of nodes.
