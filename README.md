# Active/Active Cloud Infrastructure Back-end Setup

Infrastructure setup for the CS308 VCU Capstone Project. The files in this repository will set up essential utilities on your AWS instances for an intercommunicating cluster of AWS nodes. 

The testing environment may be replicated by following the guide below:

1.) Create your nodes on AWS and distribute them among the different availability zones evenly 
  *(i.e. node1 in US-east-1a, node2 in US-east-1b, node3 in US-east-1c). An odd number of instances is recommended for this setup to maintain a quorum number of nodes.
